<h3>Introduction</h3>
Everyone has something they don't need and want to sell. The item could be advertised in many different ways like printouts pinned somewhere in the lobby or a laundry room. Or pay social media influencers to advertise but physical pinned adsa can easily get tampered with and social media advertising is very expensive.

When a new product is out in the market an advertising system makes it possible to inform customers. Advertising is not only for well known companies or professionals but it is for everybody who wants to sell or buy.
